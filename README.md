# WeatherApplication_ServerSide

- BackEnd of WeatherApp, coupled with the ReactFront End, using Express Framework for routing and MongoDB for data storage.
- create default db and collection in your mongoDB (dBName : weather, collection : weather_data) before connecting to MongoDB
- Check package.json to ensure dependencies are all met, run npm install for unmet dependencies
- To run the server, route to /bin and run <node www> to run the server. You should also be enabling MongoDB server (ex: Ubuntu : sudo mongod)
